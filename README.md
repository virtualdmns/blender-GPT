## Features

- **Natural Language Scene Generation**:
  - Describe your scene in plain English (e.g., "Create a forest with trees, mushrooms, and rocks" or "Build an animated solar system with planets orbiting the sun using keyframes"), and BlenderGPT will generate a Blender Python script to build it.
  - Execute the script immediately to see your scene come to life in Blender.

- **Flexible Interaction Methods**:
  - **Chat Interface**: Use the chat system to have a conversation with BlenderGPT. Ask questions, request scripts, or refine your scene step-by-step. For example, you can start with "Can I have a solar system model?" and follow up with "Make it animated with keyframes" to iteratively build your scene.
  - **Direct Prompt in Generate Scene**: Enter a prompt in the "Generate Scene" section for a more straightforward approach. This is perfect for one-off scene generation or when you know exactly what you want.

- **Iterative Scene Enhancement**:
  - Refine your scene over multiple iterations by adding complementary elements. For example, after creating a forest, you can add rocks, wildlife, or a river in subsequent iterations.
  - Each iteration includes a 1-second pause for visual feedback, and you can cancel at any time by pressing the Esc key.
  - A progress bar tracks the current iteration and percentage completion during iterative generation.

- **Script Execution from Chat**:
  - When using the chat, if you request a script (e.g., "Write a script to create a solar system with animated orbits"), BlenderGPT will generate the script and display it in the chat.
  - Click the "Execute Script" button directly in the chat to run the script and see the result in your Blender sceneâ€”no need to copy or paste.

- **Quick Actions**:
  - Add common elements like cubes, lights, or cameras with a single click, or clear the scene instantly.
  - These actions are great for quick prototyping or setting up a scene before using AI to enhance it.

- **Chat Interface**:
  - Interact with BlenderGPT to generate scripts, ask questions, or refine your scene through a simple chat interface.
  - View the full chat history, clear it with the "Clear" button, or copy it to your clipboard with "Copy Chat" for easy sharing.
  - Click on any line of a message in the chat to view the full message in a popup, making it easy to read longer responses.
